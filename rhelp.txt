------------------------------------

As you wander around Weird City, a
kindly old man approaches you. He
invites you to earn $500 by taking
part in a simple market research
study.

"Sure," you say..
                  like a fool.

-----------------------------------

The kindly old man grabs you by the
arm and pulls you into his lab,
through a door marked:
                 LAB

The old man straps you to a table!
He introduces himself as the evil
Profesor Klystron!! (Arrrrgghh!)

He injects into you a mysterious
liquid.

-----------------------------------

As you look about the room, everything
seems to be growing larger and larger!
You soon realise that you are
shrinking! (Screams of terror!)

You notice that you've also grown a
tail.

The evil Professor picks you up
and places you in a tiny doorway. He
pushes you through and the door slams
shut behind you.

You crave cheese.

-----------------------------------

You are a RAT!
You are a RAT in a maze!
The only way to return to your former
self is to find the exit. If this is
accomplished, you will be given $500
Weird Bucks for your efforts.

You will soon be shown a rat's-eye
view from inside the maze. Your
position inside the maze will be
shown in the form of X and Y.
Your goal will also be given.

You may walk in any direction where
there is an open corridor with the
†∆†orward command.

You may turn †Ã†eft, †“†ight, or
†¡†round with these commands. Note
that with these commands you only
turn; you do not actually change
your X/Y position in the maze. (You
may walk †∆†orward to do this.

It may be a good idea to map the maze.

Other commands are Re†ƒ†isplay, if the
screen gets messy, and †—†uit, for
when your mind gets messy.

------------------------------------

Version 2 supports ASCII as well at
ATASCII graphics, and includes a
couple of new goodies. Hope you
enjoy!!

------------------------------------

Good Luck, Sucker!
